# 🚀 30 Day Node.js Backend Challenge

Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents my **30 Day Node.js Backend Challenge**, where I’m diving deep into **Node.js, Express, and RESTful APIs**.

The goal isn’t perfection — it’s **showing up every day, writing code, and learning by building**.

If you’re learning backend development or Express.js, you’re more than welcome to follow along.

## 🌱 Why I Started This Challenge

Backend development can feel overwhelming — APIs, middleware, databases, authentication, errors everywhere 😅  

I started this challenge to:

- Build strong **Node.js & Express fundamentals**
- Understand how **real backend APIs** are structured
- Learn by **doing**, not just watching tutorials
- Stay consistent and accountable
- Share my progress openly (wins, bugs, and all)

- **Express.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **npm**
- REST APIs
- Databases (added during the challenge)
